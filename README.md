Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with those looking for accommodations. It allows users to book unique places to stay—like apartments, vacation homes, or even treehouses—directly from hosts. The platform also lets hosts manage listings, interact with guests, and accept bookings securely.

This project is a simplified clone of Airbnb, focusing on core features such as:
User authentication and session management
Property listing by hosts
Browsing available homes
Saving favorites
